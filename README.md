# Forex Exploit in C - a graph problem
This project is about finding arbitrage opportunities in foreign exchange rates by finding **negative weight cycles** by implemeting the **Bellmann Ford Alogrithm**. Exchange rates are read from a csv file.

Would this work in practice? Most likely not as exchange rates are changed constantly to prevent this and I would be too slow filling trades.

## Example
Lets use the following currencies and fictional exchange rates.
|CHF  |EUR   |USD   |GBP   |YEN   |CAD   |
|-----|------|------|------|------|------|
|1    | 0.23 | 0.25 | 16.43| 18.21| 4.94 |
|4.34 | 1    | 1.11 | 71.40| 79.09| 21.44|
|3.93 | 0.90 | 1    | 64.52| 71.48| 19.37|
|0.061| 0.014| 0.015| 1    | 1.11 | 0.30 |
|0.055| 0.013| 0.014| 0.90 | 1    | 0.27 |
|0.20 | 0.047| 0.052| 3.33 | 3.69 | 1    |

By doing the following chain of currency changes we can find arbitrage.
```c
GBP -> YEN -> CHF -> GBP
```
```matlab
1(GBP) * 1.1 = 1.1(YEN)
1.1(YEN) * 0.05 = 0.06105(CHF)
0.06105(CHF) * 16.43 = 1.0030515(GBP)

Arbitrage of risk free: 0.003.- (GBP)
Now Repeat with 1.003(GBP)
```

Doing this from hand is tricky and takes long. This program is doing exactly that.
## Complexities
* Time: O(N^3)
* Space: O(N^2)

## Implemented Concepts 
* Pointers
* Matrices
* Solving a graph problem
* multi file project
## Running
Run make to start the program.
```bash
$ make && ./main data/example.csv
```

Output of the example data provided.

# Forex Exploit in C - a graph problem
This project is about finding arbitrage opportunities in foreign exchange rates by finding **negative weight cycles** by implemeting the **Bellmann Ford Alogrithm**. Exchange rates are read from a csv file.

Would this work in practice? Most likely not as exchange rates are changed constantly to prevent this and I would be too slow filling trades.

## Example
Lets use the following currencies and exchange rates.
|PLN  |EUR   |USD   |RUB   |INR   |MXN   |
|-----|------|------|------|------|------|
|1    | 0.23 | 0.25 | 16.43| 18.21| 4.94 |
|4.34 | 1    | 1.11 | 71.40| 79.09| 21.44|
|3.93 | 0.90 | 1    | 64.52| 71.48| 19.37|
|0.061| 0.014| 0.015| 1    | 1.11 | 0.30 |
|0.055| 0.013| 0.014| 0.90 | 1    | 0.27 |
|0.20 | 0.047| 0.052| 3.33 | 3.69 | 1    |

By doing the following chain of currency changes we can find arbitrage.
```c
RUB -> INR -> PLN -> RUB
```
```matlab
1(Rub) * 1.1 = 1.1(INR)
1.1(INR) * 0.05 = 0.06105(PLN)
0.06105(PLN) * 16.43 = 1.0030515(Rub)

Arbitrage of risk free: 0.003.- (Rub)
Now Repeat with 1.003(Rub)
```



Doing this from hand is tricky and takes long. This progam is doing exactly that.

## Credits
* For Reading the csv file I've used this piece of [code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cccsvparser/) by @Tal.
## TODOs
* Make the csv filepath an input parameter for the main programm.
